My Portfolio

Project made for the "Responsive Web Design" module in freeCodeCamp

Currently, I am an eager learner of front-end development and programming. I chose to follow the path of self-intruction as a first contact with this professional area. This way I can grasp the intricacies of this vocation at my own pace and enjoy it more. The first result of my dedication is this fancy web page summing up some of my work samples.
